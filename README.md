Every hiker/camper would love to have a leatherman pocket knife around because it is lightweight, versatile and reliable, sometimes life saving.

This is why I developed PyEarth, a lightweight Python package to support various Earth science tasks.
I use it in my daily work, and nearly all my research papers use it in some way.

It is supposed to be lightweight, so that you won't be stopped by Conda install because of dependency issues.
You can also clone it and just use the functions you need.

It is supposed to be versatile, so that you can use it for various tasks, such as GIS, data processing, plotting, etc.

It is designed to be a general-purpose library as it is inspired by the popular IDL Coyote library. Some of the code structure is inspired by the ArcGIS toolbox.

If you find this package useful, please cite it in your work.
You can also support it by [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/changliao) or sponsoring it on [GitHub].

### Dependency

PyEarth depends on the following packages

1. `numpy`
2. `gdal`
3. `matplotlib`
4. `cartopy`


PyEarth also has optional dependency packages for several functions:

1. `netCDF4` for netCDF support
2. `pandas` for pandas dataframes 
3. `scipy` for scientific computing
4. `statsmodels` for statistical analysis

### Documentation

Please refer to the [documentation](https://pyearth.readthedocs.io) for details on how to get started using the PyEarth package.

### Installation

`PyEarth` depends on several other packages, including gdal, which cannot be installed through `pip` easily. You are recommended to use `conda` to install dependency if necessary.

    conda install pyearth

### Content

PyEarth mainly provides many general-purpose funcations to support other libraries.
These functions are classified into several categories:
1. GIS: This component provides major spatial dataset operations.
2. Toolbox: This component provides many functions for data, date, math, etc.
3. Visual: This component provides a plotting function for time series, scatter, etc.
4. System: This component provides system-wide operations.

You can either call these functions through this package, or you can modify them for your own applications.
