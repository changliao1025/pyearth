==============================================

.. note::
   PyEarth has been restructured as part of the **EarthSuite** ecosystem.
   Some functionality has been moved to separate focused packages:

   - **pyearthviz** - 2D visualization (matplotlib/cartopy)
   - **pyearthviz3d** - 3D visualization with GeoVista
   - **pyearthhelp** - Data retrieval and HPC utilities
   - **pyearthmesh** - Mesh generation tools
   - **pyearthriver** - River network graph algorithms

   PyEarth now focuses on core GIS operations, spatial toolbox, and system utilities.
