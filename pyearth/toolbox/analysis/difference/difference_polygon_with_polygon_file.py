Calculate Geometric Difference Between Polygon Datasets
=========================================================

This module provides functionality to compute the geometric difference between two
polygon datasets, identifying areas in the base dataset that are not covered by
a new dataset. The operation uses spatial indexing for efficient processing of
large datasets.

The difference operation is commonly used in geospatial workflows for:

* **Change Detection**: Identify areas that have been removed or changed between
  time periods (e.g., deforestation, urban development reversal)
* **Gap Analysis**: Find coverage gaps when comparing datasets from different sources
* **Data Quality**: Validate dataset completeness by finding missing areas
* **Update Tracking**: Monitor what portions of a base dataset are not covered by
  updates or new data

Key Features
------------
- Supports multiple vector formats (GeoJSON, Shapefile, GeoPackage, KML, etc.)
- Automatic format detection based on file extension
- Efficient spatial indexing with rtree
- Geometry validation and automatic repair
- Multi-part geometry handling (MULTIPOLYGON, GEOMETRYCOLLECTION)
- Progress logging for long-running operations
- Comprehensive error handling and reporting
- Tracks source features in output (base_fid, new_fid)

Technical Details
-----------------
**Spatial Indexing**: The function uses `setup_spatial_index()` to select rtree for spatial indexing.

**Difference Operation**: For each feature in the new dataset:
1. Uses spatial index to find potentially intersecting base features (bounding box test)
2. Performs exact geometry intersection test
3. Calculates geometric difference (base geometry NOT in new geometry)
4. Outputs resulting difference polygons

**Geometry Handling**:
- Invalid geometries are automatically repaired using Buffer(0)
- Multi-part results are decomposed into individual polygons
- Empty results are filtered out

**Performance**: Spatial indexing provides O(log n) lookup time for intersection
candidates, making this suitable for large datasets with millions of features.

Notes
-----
The difference operation is NOT symmetric: difference(A, B) â‰  difference(B, A).
This function returns areas in the base dataset that are NOT in the new dataset.

Examples
--------
Detect deforestation (areas in old forest layer not in new forest layer):

    ...     'deforestation.gpkg',
    ...     spatial_ref_epsg=4326
    ... )

Find coverage gaps between datasets:

    >>> calculate_polygon_difference(
    ...     'complete_coverage.shp',
    ...     'partial_coverage.geojson',
    ...     'coverage_gaps.parquet'

    Calculate the geometric difference between base polygons and new polygons.

    This function identifies areas in the base polygon dataset that are NOT covered
    by the new polygon dataset. The operation uses spatial indexing for efficient
    processing and supports automatic format detection for input/output files.

    The difference is computed as: base_geometry - new_geometry, which returns the
    portion of the base geometry that does not overlap with the new geometry. This
    is useful for change detection, gap analysis, and data quality validation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sFilename_base : str
        Path to the base polygon file (the dataset to subtract FROM).
        Supports multiple formats: .geojson, .shp, .gpkg, .parquet, .kml, etc.
        Format is automatically detected from file extension.

    sFilename_new : str
        Path to the new polygon file (the dataset to subtract).
        Supports multiple formats with automatic detection.
        Areas covered by this dataset will be removed from base features.

    sFilename_difference_out : str
        Path for the output difference file.
        Output format is determined by file extension.
        Contains polygons representing base areas not covered by new features.

    spatial_ref_epsg : int, optional
        EPSG code for output spatial reference system.
        Default is 4326 (WGS84 lat/lon).
        Common values: 4326 (WGS84), 3857 (Web Mercator), 32633 (UTM Zone 33N), etc.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        Results are written directly to the output file.
        The function logs progress and summary statistics.

    Raises
    ------
    FileNotFoundError
        If input files don't exist or cannot be accessed.
    ImportError
        If required spatial indexing library (rtree) is not available.
    RuntimeError
        If GDAL/OGR operations fail (invalid datasets, layer access errors, etc.).
    ValueError
        If file format is not supported by GDAL/OGR.

    Notes
    -----
     1. **Spatial Indexing**: Uses rtree (libspatialindex backend) for efficient candidate lookup.
         See `setup_spatial_index()` for details.

    2. **Geometry Validation**: Invalid geometries are automatically repaired using
       the Buffer(0) technique. Features with empty or null geometries are skipped
       with warnings logged.

    3. **Multi-part Handling**: MULTIPOLYGON and GEOMETRYCOLLECTION results are
       decomposed into individual POLYGON features for cleaner output.

    4. **Output Attributes**:
       - id: Sequential polygon identifier
       - base_fid: Feature ID from base dataset (for traceability)
       - new_fid: Feature ID from new dataset that intersected

    5. **Performance**: Uses spatial indexing for O(log n) candidate lookup.
       Processing time scales well with dataset size. Progress is logged every
       100 features for long-running operations.

    6. **Memory**: Base features are cached in memory for repeated access.
       For very large datasets (millions of features), consider splitting into
       tiles or using on-disk spatial indexes.

    7. **Coordinate Systems**: Input files can be in different coordinate systems,
       but reprojection is NOT performed automatically. For accurate results,
       ensure inputs are in the same CRS or reproject before calling this function.

    8. **Empty Results**: If no differences are found (new dataset completely
       covers base dataset), an empty output file with correct schema is created.

    9. **Shapefile Cleanup**: When overwriting shapefiles, all associated files
       (.shp, .shx, .dbf, .prj, .cpg) are automatically removed.

    10. **Logging**: Progress and errors are logged using Python's logging module.
        Set logging level to DEBUG for detailed operation information.
